# Executive Summary
This document describes Version 1.1 of the public sector profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). The document is structured as follows:

* **Section 1** describes the purpose and audience of the document; 
* **Section 2** describes the main elements of the PCTF; and 
* **Sections 3** through 9 provide various appendices that cover terms and definitions, discussions on selected topics related to the PCTF, a list of issues that will be resolved in future versions of the document, and a bibliography.

The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework will facilitate the transition to a digital ecosystem for citizens and residents of Canada. A Canadian digital ecosystem will increase efficiency and secure interoperability between existing business processes, such as open banking, business licencing, and public sector service delivery. 

The PCTF is simple and integrative; technology-agnostic; complementary to existing frameworks; clearly linked to policy, regulation, and legislation; and is designed to apply relevant standards to key processes and capabilities.

The PCTF facilitates a common approach between all levels of government and the private sector thereby serving the needs of the various communities who need to trust digital identities. The PCTF is defined in a way that encourages innovation and the evolution of the digital ecosystem. The PCTF allows for the interoperability of different platforms, services, architectures, and technologies. 

The PCTF defines two types of digital representations that are essential for the development of the digital ecosystem:
* Digital identities of entities such as persons, organizations, and devices; and
* Digital relationships between entities. 

The PCTF supports the acceptance of digital identities and digital relationships by defining a set of discrete process patterns, known as atomic processes. These atomic processes can be mapped to existing business processes, independently assessed using conformance criteria, and certified to be trusted and interoperable within the digital ecosystem.

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe the public sector profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). 
The audience for this document includes:
* Business owners and program managers – to enable digital identity solutions in order to achieve business objectives or program outcomes;
* Regulatory and oversight bodies – to understand the implications on their role in the digital ecosystem; and
* Digital identity technology and service providers – to understand where they fit in the digital ecosystem and to help define requirements for their products and services.

Definitions of various terms used in this document can be found in _Appendix A: Terms and Definitions_. 

# The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework

## Background
The identity management ecosystem in Canada is comprised of multiple identity providers relying on authoritative source registries that span provincial/territorial and federal jurisdictions. Consequently, the Canadian ecosystem employs a federated identity model. 

The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) is an outcome of the Pan-Canadian approach for federating identities which is an agreement on the principles and standards to be used when developing identity solutions. This approach, embodied in the PCTF, is intended to facilitate the transition to a digital ecosystem which will enable transformative digital service delivery solutions for citizens and residents of Canada. 

## What is the PCTF?

The PCTF is a model that consists of a set of agreed-on concepts, definitions, processes, conformance criteria, and an assessment approach. It is not a “standard” as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional criteria. The role of the PCTF is to complement existing standards and policies such as those concerned with security, privacy, and service delivery.

The PCTF facilitates a common approach between the public sector and the private sector. Use of the PCTF ensures alignment, interoperability, and confidence of digital identity solutions that are intended to work across organizational, sectoral, and jurisdictional boundaries. In addition, the PCTF supplements existing legislation, regulations, and policies. 

The PCTF supports the acceptance and mutual recognition of:
* Digital identities of entities such as persons and organizations; and
* Digital relationships between entities.

The PCTF defines a set of discrete process patterns (called atomic processes) that can be mapped to business processes. This mapping makes possible a structured assessment and evaluation of a digital identity solution and identifies any dependencies on external organizations and providers.

The PCTF is technology-agnostic and is defined in a way that encourages innovation and participation in the digital ecosystem. It allows for the interoperability of different platforms, services, architectures, and technologies. Furthermore, the PCTF is designed to take into consideration international digital identity frameworks, such as: 
* The Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services (eIDAS); 
* The Financial Action Task Force (FATF); and 
* The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

Finally, it should be noted that the Public Sector Profile of the PCTF, in itself, is not a governance framework. Instead, it is a tool to help assess a digital identity program or service. 

## Scope of the PCTF
Currently, the scope of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework is:
* Persons in Canada: all citizens and residents of Canada (including deceased persons) for whom an identity has been established in Canada;
* Organizations in Canada: all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established in Canada; and
* Relationships in Canada: of persons to persons, organizations to organizations, and persons to organizations.
