## 7 <a name="APPENDIX E"></a>APPENDIX E: GUIDELINES ON MUTUAL RECOGNITION

At this time, the mutual recognition process is still in its early stages. The following sections outline some guidelines on mutual recognition at a high level. Detailed guidance will follow in subsequent deliverables.

### 7.1 Planning and Engagement

The planning and engagement step should include the following:

* **Define the Scope of the Assessment**. The scope of the assessment may include one or more parties acting in the roles defined as part of the digital ecosystem. While the primary focus of the assessment is usually a jurisdiction as an “issuer”, the assessment may include additional parties who have been delegated specific business functions or roles. The PCTF model may also be used to clarify roles and responsibilities that are relevant to, but not necessarily within the scope of the formal assessment process.
* **Formalize the Team**. Formalize the mutual recognition project team who will be responsible for the process and deliverables. The project team should consist of the assessment team and members from the participating organizations who have detailed operational knowledge of the program.
* **Site Visit**. The assessment team should perform a site visit. The desired outcome is to ensure that the assessment team members can gain direct knowledge of the program and establish close working relationships with the other mutual recognition project team members to facilitate knowledge transfer and shared understanding.
* **Define a Discrete Work Stream**. While the mutual recognition project team may be integrated into a larger project initiative, the mutual recognition process should be maintained as a discrete work stream. However, the work stream should have tight synchronization with the other work streams, such as privacy impact assessments, security assessment and authorization, and technical integration.
* **Engage Legal Counsel Early**. It is recommended that legal counsel of all parties be engaged early in the process. As the assessment process and the ensuing arrangements may be new in relation to existing arrangements, there may be implications for respective authorities and agreements.
* **Engage Privacy and Security Early**. It is recommended that the privacy and security officials of all parties be engaged early in the process since Privacy Impact Assessments and Security Assessments will need to be conducted.
* **Records Management**. Ensure that all evidence received, and assessment documents and working drafts are filed in a proper records management system under the appropriate security categorization. Upon completion of the assessment, all material should be finalized as records for audit purposes.

### 7.2 Process Mapping

The following are some recommendations for the process mapping step:

* **Define the Scope of the Mapping**. Typically the mapping will be of an established program or business line. The scope of the mapping may include upstream programs such as vital statistics or external commercial service providers. These may be included in the scope of the assessment or identified as *dependencies*.
* **Be Prepared for Terminology Variation**. Many programs under assessment will be well-established and using terminology for their context. The purpose of the mapping process is not to introduce new terminology, but rather to map what exists in name to what needs to be assessed using the PCTF.
* **Work closely with all Team Members**. A large part of the process mapping is a discovery process by the team. While existing documentation may be the primary source of information, interviews with subject matter experts and operational personnel may be required. Workshops may also need to be held to arrive at a common understanding and mapping.
* **Clarify Responsibilities Between Parties**. Similar processes may be carried out or duplicated across the different parties. For example, “enrolment” in a digital identity program, may be the same as or different from a subsequent “enrolment” in a service that has accepted the digital identity. The mapping of the atomic processes can help to clarify what may be a duplicate (i.e., redundant) process to the user, and what may be specifically required for the service.

### 7.3 Assessment

Assessment requires a judgment call by an impartial expert using the best and most complete information available. At its simplest, the assessment determination may be a simple PASS/FAIL. However, in practice, the assessor may require additional gradations to express concerns made at the time of the determination or to reflect that certain information may be incomplete or unavailable to the assessor.

The following are the assessment determinations that have been developed so far and which may be adjusted over time. It is cautioned that assessment determinations having too many gradations may make the assessment process less transparent.

The current assessment determinations in use are:

* **Accepted** – The conformance criteria are met;
* **Accepted with Observation** – The conformance criteria are met, but a dependency or contingency over which the assessed party might not have direct control has been noted;
* **Accepted with Recommendation** – The conformance criteria are met, but a potential improvement or enhancement should be implemented in the future;
* **Accepted with Condition** – The conformance criteria are not met, but the atomic process is accepted due to the demonstration of safeguards, compensating factors, or other assurances in place;
* **Not Accepted** – The conformance criteria are not met; or
* **Not Applicable** – The conformance criteria do not apply.

### 7.4 Acceptance

Upon completion of the assessment process, a *Letter of Acceptance* is issued to the jurisdiction. This letter should:

* Be addressed to the person/organization/jurisdiction accountable for being the issuer of the digital identity;
* Be signed by the person/organization/jurisdiction accepting the digital identity at a given qualifier level;
* Include the specific scope or use of the digital identity, including the time period; and,
* Include an annex listing the specific qualifiers (e.g., levels of assurance), and any observations, conditions, or recommendations arising from the assessment process.
